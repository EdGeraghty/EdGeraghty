### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly work in Java and Bashscript nowadays, but as my Github will attest, I do dabble in othersâ€ 

My prime focus is Security, both Technical and Organisational - I get excited by novel approaches to daily problems.

Contact me on [my personal Matrix account](https://matrix.to/#/@ed:geraghty.london) or [my work Matrix account](https://matrix.to/#/@edg=40privacyinternational.org:privacyinternational.org)


â€  please don't make me work in Python
