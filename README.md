### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Technologist [@privacyint](https://privacyinternational.org)

I mostly work in Java and Bashscript these days, but have been known to dabble in othersâ€ .

My prime focus is Security, both Technical and Organisational.

Contact me on [my personal Matrix account](https://matrix.to/#/@ed:geraghty.london) or [my work Matrix account](https://matrix.to/#/@edg=40privacyinternational.org:privacyinternational.org)


â€  please don't make me work in Python
